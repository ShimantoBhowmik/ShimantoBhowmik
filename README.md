## Bio
🐾 Computer Science student from Rochester Institute of Technology, Class of '26.

🌱 Spring 2024: I got promoted to a part-time Machine Learning Engineer at SageAI. Oh, I also took up an exciting research opportunity for a Data Science Learning platform!

🍝 Fall 2023: I worked as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at SageAI.

☁️ Summer 2023: I worked at Amazon as a Software Development Engineering Intern for Amazon Alexa.

🎨 I have always been intrigued by art. I have never learned art myself but I have a lot of respect for people who do know how to art. In my little attempts to do art, I just manipulate images using Matlab :).

🎸 I know how to play the guitar. Mostly simple chords to sing along slow-paced songs. Nothing too fancy.


## To Code or not to Code 🖥️
In my coding journey I've come to appreciate the subtle artistry within the realms of programming. Initially my were efficiency and functionality which overshadowed the elegance of structure in my code. However as I now have learned to appreciate readable and structured code.

In my early days coding felt like sketching on a vast canvas where the rush of creation took over me. As I moved from being a beginner to a more experienced coder I came to realize what makes code really beautiful isn't just how well it works but how clear and easy to understand it is for others who come take a look at my canvas. For example I like giving meaningful variable names. (x,y) is for coordinates in Math, not variable names in my coding handbook. (Oh did I mention, I am doing a Math minor as well?)

My coding journey thus far in 1 line: Somwhere between O(n^2) and O(n), I grew up.
